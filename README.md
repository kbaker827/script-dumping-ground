# Script Dumping Ground

Welcome to my collection of PowerShell, Bash, and other utility scripts. This is my personal repository for scripts I either stumble across that prove useful, or tools I've written myself to solve real-world problems.

## What's Here?

This repo is exactly what the name suggests—a **dumping ground**. It's not polished software, it's not a framework, and it's definitely not enterprise-grade code (most of the time). It's a mix of:

- **Scripts I found** - Useful tools from the community that I want to save and share
- **Scripts I wrote** - Solutions to problems I've encountered in IT administration
- **Quick fixes** - One-off tools that solved a specific issue
- **Proof-of-concepts** - Ideas that worked well enough to keep around

## Organization

The repo is organized into folders by category or tool. Each folder typically contains:
- The main script(s)
- A README with usage instructions
- Sometimes example data or configuration files

## Using These Scripts

**⚠️ Important:** These scripts are provided as-is. Before running anything:

1. **Read the README** in each folder for specific requirements and usage
2. **Test in a non-production environment** first
3. **Review the code** - understand what it does before executing
4. **Run with appropriate privileges** - many scripts require admin rights

- Software installation and removal
- Registry modifications
- File system changes
- Service and process management
- Remote command execution

Always test thoroughly in your environment before production use.
